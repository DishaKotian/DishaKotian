# Hey there, I'm Disha Kotian 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a 3rd-year B.Tech student passionate about building things that matter.  I love exploring full-stack development, blockchain technology, real-time systems, and diving into system design principles.

## What You'll Find Here

My repositories showcase projects ranging from web applications to backend systems, along with experiments in blockchain and real-time technologies.  I believe in learning by building, so you'll find a mix of coursework, personal projects, and collaborative experiments here.

## Tech Stack

**Languages:**  
Python • Java • C • JavaScript • SQL • HTML5 • CSS3

**Frameworks & Tools:**  
React. js • Node.js • Flask • Git • GitHub • VS Code

**Databases:**  
MySQL • MongoDB

## Getting Started with My Projects

Most of my projects include a README with setup instructions.  Here's the general flow:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DishaKotian/repository-name.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd repository-name

# Follow the setup instructions in the project's README
```

Each project may have specific dependencies or setup steps, so be sure to check the individual README files. 

## Let's Collaborate

I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and learning opportunities!  If you have ideas for a project, find a bug, or just want to connect: 

- Feel free to open an issue or pull request on any repository
- Reach out if you'd like to work on something together
- Suggestions and constructive feedback are always welcome

## A Little Extra

When I'm not coding, I'm probably reading about the latest tech trends, exploring new frameworks, or trying to optimize something that probably doesn't need optimizing (yet).

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀
